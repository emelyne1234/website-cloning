    <h2>Reason for Our Action</h2>
    <div class="about_us">
      As climate change tears through our current ecosystem there have been many efforts to mitigate its spread and
      impact;
      from sensitizing images of places stricking with its effects, to solutions to replace harmful processes that
      contribute
      to its spread. However, to no avail all have proved unsustainable from the social responsibility aspect. Due to
      the
      structure of these solutions they have a strong rejection factor on peoples everyday activities as they are
      preoccupied
      with other tasks during the day, the topic of climate change ever crosses their mind, this is especially for the
      lives
      of common people who might never face such effects from the climate. The key note in this problem is seen in the
      synchronisation of this solution into peoples everyday lives; and The Triple R Revolution aims to solve this by
      fitting
      into a solution that involves interaction with the basic part of everyones lives, the social aspect; and in
      particular a
      social media platform that encourages the tenets of a sustainable world REUSE, REDUCE RECYCLE.

    <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
    <div id="about_us" class="about_div d-flex">
      <div class="card">
        Increase awareness of environmental issues: One of the primary objectives of the project should be to increase
        awareness
        of environmental issues. By allowing users to post pictures and videos of their recycling, reusing, and
        reducing
        activities, the platform can help raise awareness of environmental issues and the importance of
        environmentally
        friendly
        behaviors.
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        Reduce waste and promote recycling: The project's focus on recycling, reusing, and reducing should also have
        the
        objective of reducing waste and promoting recycling. By highlighting the benefits of recycling and reusing,
        the
        platform
        can encourage users to adopt more sustainable consumption habits, reducing waste and promoting the circular
        economy.
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        Promote collaboration on environmental initiatives: The project's platform can bring people with similar
        environmental
        interests together, and it is important to promote collaboration on environmental initiatives. By encouraging
        users to
        share their ideas and collaborate on environmental initiatives, the project can help foster a sense of
        community
        and
        empower users to make a difference.
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        Encourage sustainable lifestyle changes: Another important objective of the project should be to encourage
        sustainable
